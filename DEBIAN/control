Package: com.r3st1t0u.substratefix
Name: Substrate Fix for Yalub3
Depends: mobilesubstrate
Version: 1.2
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Description: Adds the command "execute" in terminal which enables substrate and launches LaunchDaemons that currently aren't launching automatically. This fixes tweaks such as Rocketbootstrap and Anemone. This is for iPhone 7 users on the mach_portal jailbreak. As of version 1.1, this should support other tweaks that usually would need a reinstall. It also no longer reinstalls packages through the script, and it enables them with the tweak’s LaunchDaemon. This version should enable compatibility with all tweaks that rely on /Library/LaunchDaemons/. This version also changes the command used from “fix” to “execute” because quite a few people requested for me not to use fix. Version 1.2 fixes an error on my part causing this not to function every time.
